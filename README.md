# GTA SA GPS Redux

This mod includes automatic navigation for mission markers as well as the player target.
If you'd like to contribute, go ahead.

## Known Issues
The mod currently doesn't work with pickups due to technical reasons.
In some missions, a nav route will not appear for a valid target. 
This is a limitation of SA's pathfinding, as some coordinates break it and make it not generate any path. This also happens with the target route.
